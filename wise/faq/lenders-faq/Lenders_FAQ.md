# Lenders FAQ

## Q: Can I take my money back out whenever I want?

A: Yes you can as long as there are enough funds in the pool that aren't being borrowed (this should always be the case). If 100% of the pool funds were being utilized, then your APY in the pool could be as high as 500%. Realistically, lenders would add more funds to the pool and/or some borrowers would pay back their loans to avoid the high APY before the pool got that much out of hand. Each pool's LASA dynamically adjusts APY to match demand, creating a constant equilibrium.

## Q: Does the Wise team have any admin privileges to remove my funds from the pool?

A: Absolutely not! Our contracts are completely decentralized by every sense of the word.
