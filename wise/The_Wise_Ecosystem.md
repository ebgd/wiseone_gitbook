# üåêThe Wise Ecosystem

The fairest, safest, and most decentralized DeFi ecosystem ever built, and the best place to earn more crypto.

## WiseLending.com - Our Flagship dApp to Lend/Borrow/Earn

The Wise Lending protocol is a one-stop-shop for every-day financial needs in crypto. Deposit crypto to start earning, and grow your portfolio without having to lock any funds. Borrow against deposits at will, and access competitive yield-farming strategies, by opening a Power Farm leveraged position, built using tried and battle tested yield giants.

## $WISE Token - The Reserve Token of our Ecosystem

WISE token, launched Nov 2020, is unlike any other token in existence. It has $1/4 Billion in locked Uniswap liquidity and a price floor in ETH. WISE tokens are NOT used to pay out base rewards to our dApp users (users earn base yield in the same assets they deposit), WISE is NOT hyper-inflationary, and WISE does NOT have any whale wallets. **WISE is an ideal reserve token.**

## Driving Value back to the Community, not Insiders

90% of Wise Lending's revenue is committed to buying and burning WISE tokens (the remaining 10% goes to the DAO). WISE already has a solid foundation of value from its ETH price floor and lack of whale wallets, so this stream of buy-and-burn revenue translates directly to the growth of the WISE market cap. Join an ecosystem that efficiently and effectively rewards the community, not insiders.

## How can your Project benefit from the Wise Ecosystem?

Joining the Wise Ecosystem is easy if your project has a token and maintains a Uniswap liquidity pool. Simply pair your token with WISE for liquidity instead of ETH and your token will piggy-back on the value created by our Ecosystem. This can be done as part of a launch plan, or retroactively after launch, if your team has control of the liquidity pool. If your project is a token-less project, you can still join by maintaining a portion of your treasury/balance sheet in WISE. Grants/developer support are available on a case-by-case basis for those who wish to join our ecosystem.
